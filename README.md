# Scheme Interpreter

This project is a web-based Scheme interpreter that runs entirely in the browser. The Scheme intepreter runs [CS 61A Scheme](https://cs61a.org/articles/scheme-spec/), a flavor of Scheme used in UC Berkeley's CS 61A course. The interpreter's structure is loosely based on the Scheme project from that course.

## Running in the Browser

The web-based interpreter can be found at [chrispyles.io/scheme-interpreter](https://chrispyles.io/scheme-interpreter).

## Running Locally

This project also includes a command-line REPL that can also be used to execute Scheme code. To use it, clone this repository and run the `start` script:

```
git clone https://github.com/chrispyles/scheme-interpreter
cd scheme-interpreter
npm install
npm run start
```
